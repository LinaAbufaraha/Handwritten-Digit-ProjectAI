# Handwritten-Digit-ProjectAI
This project focuses on building a Handwritten Digit Recognition System capable of recognizing numbers written in both Arabic and English. The system uses three machine learning models: Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). A graphical user interface (GUI) was implemented to provide a user-friendly way to upload images and get predictions.


This project supports two datasets:

Arabic Handwritten Digits Dataset 
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle. consists of 88,000 images, divided as follows:

Training set:   60,000 images
Test set:          28,000 images


English Handwritten Digits Dataset
MNIST Dataset the dataset was preloaded in Python using TensorFlow/Keras:

Training set:   60,000 images
Test set:          10,000  images


The project successfully demonstrated the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms for handwritten digit recognition in both Arabic and English languages. 

The CNN model consistently achieved the highest accuracy, showcasing its ability to learn complex patterns in images. 

The user-friendly GUI enables real-time predictions, making the system practical for various applications.
